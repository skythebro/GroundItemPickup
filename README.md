# GroundItemPickup

# A server-side only mod that allows admins to teleport items to their inventory.
* This mod basically has one command called `.addItems` Usage: `.addItems [radius]`
* Feel free to expand upon this. Maybe add a dictionary so players can filter which items they want to be picked up. Or add a coroutine so the server every so often picks up items for all players.
* Maybe add an opt in or opt out command so users can opt in or out of the auto item pickup.
* Add commands so players can set item pickup filters.
